## Steps
1. Have yertle draw an equilateral triangle using a loop. How many times should the loop run? Remember that it ran 4 times for a square, so how many for a triangle? What angle should you use for the turns? One way to figure this out is to notice that to complete a shape, all the exterior angles should add up to 360 degrees. So, for a square 4x90 = 360.
2. Have yertle draw a pentagon using a loop. A pentagon has 5 sides. What external angle should you use for the turns? Remember they have to add up to 360 degrees.
3. Create a variable n that holds the number of sides for any polygon, and use n in your loop for the sides and to calculate the angle to turn. Can you have the loop draw a variety of shapes by just changing the value of the variable n? The power of abstraction! Can you draw a 9 sided nonagon? (Note that if the turtle runs into walls, it stays there and will mess up the shape, so you may have to move the turtle or go forward smaller amounts).
